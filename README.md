Hello human enthusiasts!
Unparallelparadox here, I like to dive into everything I don't know, because I don't know what I don't know, and I would love to learn all that this lifetime will allot me to know!  I also live in two different dimensions of this place we call earth, having being raised in Alabama, and born in Korea.  North or South?  Both!  Oh, and moon tacos are the best!
